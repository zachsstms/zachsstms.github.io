Yo! My name is Zach Selzman and I am a current junior at Cal Poly studying Aerospace engineering. This website was created primarily to give myself an avenue to vent about my excursions in the mountains (check out [the blog](/blog/)). Other than that, I have some projects I found interesting enough to get me off instagram reels [over here](/projects/).
I'm just getting started with this, so more content will follow as I get the hang of github pages (I lack both a motivation and aptitude for web development).


If you want to  Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
