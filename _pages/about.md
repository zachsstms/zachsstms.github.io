Yo! My name is Zach Selzman and I am a current junior at Cal Poly studying Aerospace engineering. This website was created primarily to give myself an avenue to vent about my excursions in the mountains (check out [the blog](/blog/)). Other than that, I have some projects I found interesting enough to get me off instagram reels [over here](/projects/).
I'm just getting started with this, so more content will follow as I get the hang of github pages (I lack both a motivation and aptitude for web development).


I'm using the code from another generous [github user](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) as a template, so the site will still be littered with some stuff that is quite broad, such as ["a post with image galleries"](blog/2025/plotly/). Over time, I hope to develop this site out to truly make it mine, although the process is a bit tedious and it could take a while—appreciate the patience. 

Assuming we're strangers, I'm a student and a mountain enthusiast—seldom complementary things...well, as long as GPA is concerned. Nonetheless, I am extremely passionate about Aerodynamics, Aeroelasticity, Envrionmental Fluid Mechanics, and Flight Test. Basically, I like the intersection of planning, design and computation with hands-on work, specifically field test engineering and validation. I was extremely fortunate to have spent last summer as an intern at the Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Lab (err...the ["National Lab of the Rockies"](https://www.nrel.gov/wind/nwtc/)). There, I was able to observe and integrate myself into the Field Test and Validation group, which was responsible for effectively confirming predictions from the Numerical Modeling groups and conducting measurements for private companies looking to certify their products. I learned a great deal about working with a team in addition to the inner-workings of Excel Macro codes. It was cool to see a role nestled perfectly at the intersection between theory and practice—making me incredibly interested in the Field Test industry as well. 

My decision to join `NREL` originated with my passion for renewable energy and wind turbine aerodynamics. I've spent nearly two years with [Cal Poly Wind Power](https://calpolywindpower.org/), working as a member of the Aerodynamics team. I've learned a great deal about the aerodynamics of rotating bodies, and have participated in nearly every stage of the development of the turbine blades, from modeling to testing. The annual aim is to win the [Collegiate Wind Power Competition](https://www.energy.gov/eere/collegiatewindcompetition/collegiate-wind-competition), which essentially characterizes my job as an `optimizer and validater.`

Outside of academics and engineering, I enjoy various self-actualizing hobbies, including skiing, running, climbing, and ocassionally paragliding.
